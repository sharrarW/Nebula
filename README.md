MISSION STATEMENT:

Nebula Problem statement:

 

When we look at the world around us, everything seems to be moving and transforming in an instant. We’ve seen the revolution the Internet has brought upon us – smartphones, smart homes, even refrigerators that let you know when you’re out of food. Yet, after being around technology all throughout the day, we get into our combustible engine, mid 2000’s car, set up Bluetooth, plug in our phone charger and head home. Driving has become a chore.

 

Nebula was created from a vision that a car could transform your day, just as the iPhone had transformed the way we interact. From the first time you sit inside automatic body contouring seats that reshape to fit you, to the time you step on the carbon ceramic brakes, you’ll know this is something from out of this world.

 

I created this landing page as a fan of cars and technology, and where we can be in the future if we embrace it. I wanted to specifically create a landing page that would highlight the car itself, it’s features and the company’s history, and let people sign up to learn more.
